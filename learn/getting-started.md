# Introduction

## What is Wool?

**Wool is an ecosystem for typescript**. It includes a package manager, compiler and decentralised registries.

It is an alternative to projects like [npm](#) and [lerna](#).

As a fully integrated, zero config, comprehensive tool, it covers all your needs for building any-scale web and command line applications.

It is specifically designed to [make business stake-holders happy](#), and simplify the lives of developers.

## Getting Started

Once you've [installed](/install.html) Wool, the best way to get started is to create a new project.

```
wool init my-project
```

This will create a starter project with the structure:

```
my-project/
  .gitignore
  index.ts
  wool.json
  wool.lock
```
